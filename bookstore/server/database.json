      "author": "Jane Austen",
      "description": "A novel of manners about the romantic pas de deux between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, two perfectly suited lovers who, at first, find each other insufferable. Despite Elizabeth's negative feelings about Darcy, fate seems determined to keep throwing this pair together, and Darcy, almost in spite of himself, will make revelations that will end up causing Elizabeth to question everything she believes. Set in a time when marrying well was a woman's only way to assure a secure and comfortable future, Pride and Prejudice is arguably the forerunner of all romantic comedies and certainly one of the best-loved novels of all time.",

Narrator Ishmael, along with the whaleship Pequod's other \"meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways\", is beguiled into joining Captain Ahab in his vengeful pursuit of the white whale that \"dismasted\" him. But along the way, Ishmael takes the reader along many a detour into variegated ways of knowing. In a tone \"strangely compounded of fun and fury\", Moby-Dick brings outlandish curiosity to bear on the multitudinous, oceanic scale of our diverse world",
