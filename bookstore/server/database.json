Set in a time when marrying well was a woman's only way to assure a secure and comfortable future, Pride and Prejudice is arguably the forerunner of all romantic comedies and certainly one of the best-loved novels of all time.",

But along the way, Ishmael takes the reader along many a detour into variegated ways of knowing. In a tone \"strangely compounded of fun and fury\", Moby-Dick brings outlandish curiosity to bear on the multitudinous, oceanic scale of our diverse world",
